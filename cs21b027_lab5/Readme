For running prob1:
make fname=prob1
./parser inp1.txt

For running prob2:
make fname=prob2
./parser inp2.txt

Makefile is using ll as a linker. 

Note:

1. For prob1, I have taken non imaginary numbers (real numbers) as correct or valid complex numbers

2. Make sure to separate all inputs (correct or incorrect) with semicolons as delimiters as specified in the question
